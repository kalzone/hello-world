Just Another Repo

I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.

Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.

Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.

There's a way to do it better - find it.

There is no substitute for hard work.

Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
